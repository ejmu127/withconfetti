# Confetti Virtual Team Building: Effortless Event Planning, Professional Hosts, Happiness Guaranteed

Remote work has changed how teams connect. Video calls and Slack messages keep projects moving, but they don't build the kind of bonds that happen naturally when teams share an office. That's where Confetti steps in.

This platform has become the go-to solution for companies looking to bring remote and hybrid teams together through professionally hosted virtual experiences. What makes it different? Simple booking, expert hosts who actually know how to engage people, and a catalog of experiences that goes way beyond generic icebreakers.

## What Actually Is Confetti?

Confetti is a digital events platform specializing in professionally hosted virtual and hybrid team-building experiences. Founded in 2017 by Lee Rubin and Eyal Hakim, the company set out to solve a problem that's become even more relevant in recent years: how do you create meaningful connections when your team is scattered across different cities, time zones, or even continents?

The platform serves as an end-to-end solution. You browse their catalog of experiences, book what fits your team, and show up. Everything else—coordination with hosts, event materials, customized invitations, even shipping physical kits when needed—gets handled by Confetti's team.

Over 25,000 companies have used the platform, including recognizable names like Google, Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Microsoft. They've organized more than 52,000 events, which means they've seen what works (and what doesn't) when it comes to keeping remote teams engaged.

## The Experience Categories

Confetti organizes its offerings into several main categories, each designed to serve different team needs:

**Team Building Games & Activities**  
These are the experiences that get people laughing, competing, and collaborating. Virtual escape rooms combine puzzle-solving with teamwork. Murder mysteries put everyone in detective mode. Trivia games (with 30+ customization options) let teams test their knowledge on topics ranging from pop culture to company-specific questions. There's also Coworker Feud (think Family Feud for remote teams), Pictionary, Taboo, and even drag queen bingo for teams that want something more unconventional.

**Classes with Kits**  
This category ships physical materials to participants before the event. Mixology classes teach cocktail-making skills (with ingredients delivered). Terrarium workshops guide teams through creating their own mini-gardens. Painting sessions, candle-making, cookie decorating, chocolate tasting, and even hot sauce challenges—all designed so everyone can participate from home with the same materials. The kits eliminate the "did everyone remember to grab supplies?" problem.

**Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Events**  
Confetti offers DEI-focused workshops that encourage teams to think beyond surface-level conversations. These include interactive sessions on microaggressions and implicit bias, cultural celebrations like Lunar New Year or Black History Month activities, and museum tours highlighting diverse art and history. The goal is active participation, not passive listening.

**Health & Wellness Experiences**  
Remote work can be isolating and stressful. Confetti's wellness offerings include yoga sessions (including laughter yoga and chair yoga for desk workers), guided meditation, wellness talks, and stress-relief exercises. These aren't just nice-to-haves—companies are starting to recognize that employee wellbeing directly impacts productivity and retention.

**Learning & Development**  
Professional development doesn't have to mean sitting through another webinar. Confetti offers workshops on communication skills, effective questioning techniques, public speaking, creative thinking, and more. Teams leave with actionable scripts and real examples they can apply immediately.

**Seasonal Celebrations**  
Holiday parties, end-of-year celebrations, Employee Appreciation Day events—Confetti creates themed experiences throughout the year. Their holiday collection has become particularly popular, offering everything from festive cocktail classes to winter-themed escape rooms.

## How the Booking Process Works

One of Confetti's strengths is how straightforward they've made the process. Here's what it looks like:

1. **Browse the catalog**: Filter by event type, team size, budget, or format (virtual, hybrid, or in-person)
2. **See instant pricing**: Unlike many event platforms that require you to request a quote, Confetti shows prices upfront
3. **Book in a few clicks**: Select your date, customize event details, and complete payment
4. **Receive event materials**: Confetti sends detailed briefings, customized invitations, and Zoom links
5. **Show up**: Professional hosts run the entire event

The platform integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and other video conferencing tools, so teams don't need to learn new software.

## Pricing Structure: What You'll Actually Pay

Confetti operates on per-event pricing based on team size and experience type. Here's what the research shows about current pricing:

Confetti also offers volume discounts for companies booking multiple events throughout the year. Enterprise clients can negotiate custom packages with reduced per-event rates.

**Referral Program**: Both the referrer and the referred company receive $100 credits once the first event is completed.

## Promotions & Ways to Save

While Confetti doesn't constantly run promotional campaigns, here are the verified ways to save:

**Newsletter Signup**: New customers receive a one-time 10% discount code when they subscribe to Confetti's email newsletter.

**Seasonal Promotions**: The platform typically offers 10-20% discounts during holidays like Employee Appreciation Day, end-of-year celebrations, and other seasonal periods.

**Bundle Discounts**: Event bundles can save 12-18% compared to booking experiences separately. This works well for companies planning quarterly or monthly team events.

## What Users Actually Say

The feedback from companies using Confetti is overwhelmingly positive, particularly around three areas:

**Ease of Use**: Event planners consistently mention how much time Confetti saves. One user summed it up: "I barely have to do anything. Just pick the activity and pay an invoice. It really is that simple."

**Host Quality**: The professional hosts receive consistent praise for keeping energy high and engaging even the quietest team members. They're not just running a script—they're trained to read the room (virtual or otherwise) and adjust accordingly.

**Customer Service**: Confetti's support team is responsive and helpful. When issues arise (which, in thousands of events, they occasionally do), the company works to make things right. Their "Happiness Guarantee" means if you're not satisfied with an experience, they'll provide a free redo or full refund.

The platform holds high ratings across review sites like Capterra and GetApp, with users particularly appreciating the transparent pricing, wide variety of options, and seamless booking process.

## The Downsides (Yes, There Are Some)

No platform is perfect. Here are the common concerns:

**Pricing**: Confetti isn't the cheapest option out there. Some reviewers note that certain events can be pricey, especially for smaller teams or startups with limited budgets. However, most agree the quality justifies the cost for corporate environments where team engagement directly impacts productivity.

**Limited Customization**: While Confetti offers some customization options, teams looking for highly specific or branded experiences may find the platform somewhat rigid. The trade-off is simplicity—extensive customization typically requires more back-and-forth communication, which defeats the "plug and play" appeal.

**No Hybrid Options for All Events**: While Confetti has expanded its hybrid offerings (experiences that work for both remote and in-office team members), not every event accommodates this format. Teams with split work arrangements need to carefully check which experiences suit their setup.

## Who Should Use Confetti?

This platform works best for:

- **HR and People Ops teams** responsible for employee engagement and culture
- **Remote-first companies** looking to maintain team connection across time zones
- **Managers planning quarterly or monthly team events** who want to delegate the logistics
- **Companies with 10+ employees** (smaller teams might find better value with less formal activities)
- **Organizations that value professional hosting** over DIY team-building attempts

Confetti is particularly valuable if you're tired of planning events yourself, want consistent quality, or need to scale team-building across multiple departments or locations.

## How Confetti Compares to Alternatives

**vs. TeamBuilding.com**: TeamBuilding.com focuses primarily on virtual activities with straightforward game hosting. Confetti offers both virtual and in-person experiences with broader vendor diversity and more comprehensive planning support.

**vs. DIY Solutions**: Running your own trivia night or virtual happy hour costs less but requires someone on your team to plan, coordinate, and host. If that person's time is valuable, the cost savings disappear quickly.

**vs. Other Platforms**: Confetti's differentiator is the end-to-end service. Many platforms connect you with vendors but leave coordination to you. Confetti handles everything, which matters more for busy teams.

## Best Practices for Getting the Most Value

Based on user feedback and platform features, here are some tips:

**Survey your team first**: Before booking, gather input on activity preferences, timing, and formats. Higher participation means better ROI.

**Start with virtual experiences**: If you're new to Confetti, virtual events offer lower commitment while you evaluate whether the platform fits your team.

**Plan recurring events**: Regular team-building (monthly or quarterly) delivers better culture results than occasional large events.

**Mix it up**: Alternate between competitive games, creative workshops, and wellness activities to engage different personalities on your team.

**Use the feedback**: Confetti provides post-event analytics. Use this data to continuously improve your team-building program.

**Book with adequate notice**: For virtual events, one to two weeks typically works. In-person events need three to four weeks minimum, especially for larger groups or custom experiences.

## The Bottom Line

Confetti has carved out a clear position in the corporate event space: professional, easy to use, and designed specifically for the challenges of remote and hybrid work. The platform won't be the right fit for every company—particularly those with very small teams or extremely tight budgets—but for organizations that value employee engagement and want to simplify event planning, it delivers.

The combination of transparent pricing, quality hosts, diverse experience options, and genuine customer support makes Confetti a solid choice for teams looking to move beyond generic Zoom fatigue and create actual moments of connection.

If you're responsible for keeping your remote team engaged, Confetti is worth exploring. The platform offers a free demo event option through their monthly "hello&demo" series, which gives you a risk-free way to experience their approach firsthand.
